Introduction 
ADHD is a neurodevelopment disorder often classified by a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity found in both children and adult. If you or your loved ones has suffered from ADHD, you might be familiar with its impact and side effect on the victim’s daily life. The after-effects of ADHD vary from person to person. Some, find difficulty in doing their daily activities while others can cope with it in their life. We can verify that numerous individuals in our vicinity have been diagnosed with ADHD and are working against its symptoms to establish a stable life.
As part of my dissertation work for the academic year 2023-2024, I intend to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), exploring its manifestations and associated symptoms, as well as the efficacy of utilizing games as a means to ameliorate ADHD. This research will encompass in-depth examinations of the intersection between games and ADHD, the influence of online gaming on users, and the potential for game-based interventions to enhance ADHD-related outcomes. The overarching goal of this research is to develop a dedicated gaming website tailored for individuals affected by ADHD. The creation of a gaming website specifically designed for people with ADHD serves several purposes. Firstly, it aims to raise awareness about this particular neurodevelopmental disorder among the general public. Moreover, the platform is envisaged to contribute to the enhancement of concentration, focus, and attentional capabilities among individuals grappling with ADHD. 
This undertaking is not only a manifestation of my academic pursuits but also represents an effort to apply the acquired academic competencies toward addressing a tangible real-world problem.







Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is not a newly evolved disorder. The history begins with the clinical reports about the unruliness behaviour of children, from the parts of Europe around two centuries ago. Researches and outcomes regarding ADHD are obtained from two different angles: biomedical and historical-behavioural psychology (“View of the Importance of Games for the Therapy of Children with ADHD | Seven Editora” 2023). In the scope of biomedical concept, ADHD is a neurobehavioral condition found in an individual since childhood. As stated by National Health Service(NHS), people with ADHD exhibit characteristics such as restlessness, diminished focus, deficient concentration skills, and a propensity to act impulsively. It is not a spreadable disease, rather a group of hyperactive symptoms causing changes in the behaviour, emotional intelligence, psychological, and/or learning capabilities in the victim(Furman 2005). According to cultural-historical theory, a man can change over the course of time due to the evolving circumstances. This concept broad understanding of man now and in the future. 
Signs and symptoms of ADHD can be observed in the early stage of childhood and becomes more evident in accordance with the changing environment (like when the child starts schooling). This attention deficit disorder in a child can overlap the normal behaviour development. Diagnostic manuals like DSM-5, ICD-11 and RDoC prefers diagnosis of ADHD in individuals under the age of ‘12’ if they display multiple inattentive and/or hyperactive impulsive signs. With the help of proven psychological therapy and scientific methods the symptoms can be reduced to six or less in 6 months. When it comes to older adolescents and adults, ADHD is diagnosed if there are five or more symptoms present and those symptoms interfere the growth and quality of the individual’s social, family, academic, and professional life. Since decades, the diagnostic conceptions and symptom analysis of ADHD has not changed. It is a categorial, childhood-onset neuro-developmental disorder marked by the age-inappropriate, extreme, and unbalanced attention skill, and hyperactive. 
Studies conducted by ‘The World Federation of ADHD International Consensus Statement: 208 Evidence-Based conclusions about the disorder’ states that around 5.9% of youth and 2.5% of adults are diagnosed with ADHD symptoms (Faraone et al. 2021). When we take gender into account, male-female sex ratio of having ADHD is balanced among them. In children, about 2.5 and 4 times more males than females present with ADHD (Sonuga‐Barke et al. 2022). 
What might account for ADHD? 
While the question remains pertinent, the cause is unknown up to the present date. Major factors that could be considered are:
	Premature birth of the child ( being born before the 37th week of pregnancy) 

	Low birthweight of the child.
 

	Using substances like cigarette, alcohol, and drugs during the pregnancy.
   

	Interaction with harmful substances.
 

	Genes and their interaction with environment can be a path for ADHD. Carrying out an analysis on the DNA of 20,000 ADHD people and over 35,000 without ADHD, came to conclusion that polygenic is the cause for majority cases of ADHD. This implies that a very small impact on many genetic variants in an individual can increase that chance of having ADHD.

	Nutrient Deficiencies can be a path for ADHD.  Research paper ‘‘The World Federation of ADHD International Consensus Statement: 208 Evidence-Based conclusions about the disorder’ state that reduction in ferritin (a protein that stores iron), low levels of omega-3 in blood and lack of vitamin D in maternal stage can increase the risk of ADHD. 
Refer the paper for more information: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976342100049X#sec0035
 

	Stress , Poverty, Infection, and childhood trauma can play a role in ADHD.
 

It is important to recognise that when the brain begins to function in a manner than what is considered typical, it can result in various neurological disorders. 
Cope with ADHD 
Leading a normal life in social, academic, and professional realm with ADHD is a challenging task for the victim. Life is different with ADHD and the impact also varies depending on the age frame of the individual. Guardians or Parents might encounter difficulty in encouraging the ADHD child complete their daily activities. It is important to realise that parents or guardians can neither alter nor influence the ADHD child’s behaviour. More caution needs to be given on their moves and activities as they can be restless, hyperactive, impulsive, and fearless. Taken appropriate measure by parents like planning a day, setting a routine, encouraging positive behaviour, enforceable consequences taken when boundaries are not obeyed, providing instructions, and well-timed social situations can help the child cope with ADHD. Schooling and education do play a major role in ADHD children. At some cases these children might need a helping hand to rise above in the academics 
When we take youth and adults into account, the impact of ADHD is different. Typical patients dose not experience adverse outcomes, but some might face hectic problems. Discussing the life problems of an adult ADHD patient:
•	Growth in Life
There is a large impairment in the quality of life of an adult with ADHD compared to a normal person. Emotional and social skills of the victim is affected the most compared to physical growth. The way they process and analyse a situation is different compared to their peers. Academic and professional excellences purely depend on the victim, studies do show that some excel in certain fields while others not. For instance, Michael Fred Phelps, an American former competitive swimmer, was diagnosed with ADHD on his sixth grade. He used swimming as a medium to channel his energy and it helped him to control his ADHD situation. The impulsive and hyperactive energy in Michael Pred Phelps, made him excel in sports. 
•	Accidental Injuries
Individuals, with ADHD, known for their impulsive nature are more susceptible to accidents and injuries. Due to their surplus energy, it can be challenging for them to suppress or control it. In some cases, this increased risk may even result in outcomes such, as self-harm, or premature death.
•	Crime and Conviction
120A study of the Danish population using national wide registers found that, compared with non-ADHD youth, the victims were more likely to be convicted of criminal offenses (Faraone et al. 2021). 
A highly effective approach to managing ADHD is to redirect the energy, impulsiveness, and hyperactive behaviour into a constructive outlet where the individual can excel.
Who diagnoses ADHD? 
ADHD can be diagnosed by a licensed clinician, mental health professional or physician. One of the used methods, for assessing ADHD is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is a manual that provides information, symptoms, and medical descriptions of mental health conditions. Medical professionals rely on it to analyse and diagnose ADHD. In many cases the early symptoms of ADHD are spotted in the childhood of the victim. Parents and teacher often overlook these signs, as hyperactivity is considered a typical childlike behaviour. Later in the adolescents or adulthood the victims seek for treatment. We advocate for prevention over cure; therefore, when the early signals of ADHD are spotted in the children,  refer it to your clinician/ family doctor and/or the child’s teachers.
Initially, an interview will be conducted with the patient or their family. Following the interview, an assessment is done by on the patient to find the current stage of ADHD in them. With the time-to-time clinical sessions and medications the impact of ADHD can be controlled in the victim’s life.
Games for Cognitive Improvement
Human brain develops and drastically change over the lifetime of a person. Promotion of variety of brain games, puzzles, brain teasers, and quizzes contributes to the development of specific aspects of brain function like memory, problem solving, and thinking skills. In the world of neuroscience, it has been proved that brain games can change the course of brain development in the player. 
The very first video game developed would be in 1950 by Josef Kate called ‘Bertie the Brain’(Plarium 2023). The game plays TIC-TAC-TOE and the players found it challenging to compete. This brilliance was considered as a masterpiece of AI and was displayed in Canadian National Exhibition. Bertie the Brain holds an undeniable place in the history of video games, because there was a lack of mechanisms and programming defined for video games at the time, it got dismissed from the video game category.
 
Bertie the Brain

The official video game was revealed to the world in 1958 named Tennis for Two. The player has to adjust the two knobs in the station using a small analogy computer and then push a button. Then a game of tennis gets start in an oscilloscope. 
 
	

Human urge to combine the technology, curiosity and entertainment led the way to develop video games. The word game and gamification bring to mind about the enjoyment, developed for children to facilitate creativity, enthusiasm, imagination, reasoning skills, logical thinking, and raise self-esteem. Video games aid a child to leverage feelings and emotions like sad, anger, competitive mind among other players (“View of the Importance of Games for the Therapy of Children with ADHD | Seven Editora” 2023). From the era of COVID-19, there has been a significant surge in the number of online game players. The study conducted by Statista on ‘Global Video Game Users 2027’ shows that the number of video gamers in 2023 is 2.64 billion, and this number keeps increasing till 2027. 

 
Video games have become increasingly important, in our era. It is crucial to understand their impact, on individuals and society. Incentive structure of video game, where the player gets reward if they succeed has gained the attention of the people to play game. Over the time the games were modified and updated to meet various goals like commercial purposes, branding or marketing by a company, social awareness, and for educational needs. Most children today are exposed to video games daily. Education system use the game to engage students and motivate them to perform complex, time-consuming tasks (O’Rourke et al. 2014). The satisfaction of completing a task and receiving praise gives the student to perform well with there skills. A well-developed game for children is designed after considering the psychological, academical and social life aspects. Research suggests that both praise and rewards can have effects, on players depending on the game’s intensity and the users behaviour. These effects can be positive or negative.When games reward the player for their inherent ability it supports the fixed mindset letting them belief intelligence is unchangeable. Fixed mindset let the player take negative side on the efforts, challenges, and errors. Whereas, by praising player’s effort and skill the game promotes growth mindset in them, letting them think about the positive side of taking risks and wrongdoings. 
In this phase of the research, we are going to discover the games as a treatment platform. Initially the game was designed for entertainment but now is also used for treatment purposes. Video games is the best instruction tool. Studies do show that people tend to respond well to the game instructions and follows them well in the timed frame. Games encourages the values like timely task completion, attention to details, concentration skills, persistence, knee to learn, and motivation to succeed. Considering all these factors video games used as a platform to remediate attitudinal, behavioural, and emotional processes of patients with impulse-related disorders. With the vast growth in technologies doctors and health professionals are looking for more sophisticated and cost-effective treatment methods. Games that are well-designed to cure, treat and control certain health conditions are listed below:

Overcome ADHD With Video Games

Victims of ADHD struggle to maintain attention and concentration on a single subject for an extended period. When faced with uninteresting topics, they are prone to frequent distractions. Treating these individuals with therapy, exercise, and medication also requires additional interventions like computer games to educate, train and change behaviour. Clinicians and therapists suggest using video games as a form of treatment so as to combine fun with education.
Research conducted by University of Central Florida (UFC) on ‘Kids with ADHD Must Squirm to Learn’ says that the typical intervention method of supressing the hyperactivity in ADHD children may be misguided. Using the hyperactive and impulse character in them in a monitored way can tailor their behaviour and growth with ADHD. UFC carried an experiment with an ADHD child. The child was observed in two different scenarios, in one where he was watching to MATH class and in the second one watching STAR WARS show both for same time frame. The child exhibited the ADHD symptoms like fidgety moves with hands and legs, moving around, and careless behaviour while watching MATH class. On watching the Star Wars show it was observed that his ADHD behaviour was under control.

Hence the study proved the fact that treatment method must be interesting and engaging enough for the individuals and therefore games are welcomed as part of the cure. In a video game, the player is exposed to various stimuli and learns different behaviours in accordance with scenarios that games provide (“View of the Importance of Games for the Therapy of Children with ADHD | Seven Editora” 2023). The teacher, clinician or psychologist can observe and point out behaviour patterns that the victim displays while playing the games and aid them in improving their self-control, self-esteem, focus power, and cognitive skills. With the help of well-trained video games, the therapist can even build a better interrelationship with the patient.
